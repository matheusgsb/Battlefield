# Battlefield
##### Developed by Matheus G. S. Beleboni and Diego G. da Silva

Battlefield is a simplified RPG developed as part of the Object-oriented programming (OOP) module's final coursework.


### How to play

* To move your character, just click on it and then select an empty space on the board.
* To attack another character, you need to click on the attacking character, and after that, click on the character that is being attacked (they must be from different teams).
* To use a consumable item, select the character as mentioned above and then select the character who is going to benefit from it using the right mouse button (both characters must be from the same team).


### Rules

* Teams can be created at any moment. However, there cannot be two teams with the same color.
* Before creating a new character, you must choose a position on the board.
* Consumable items are automatically added to the selected character. Hence, you can only create this kind of items when a character is selected.
* Each character can have up to one consumable item at a time. If a new consumable item is created, it goes straight to the inventory and cannot be used.
* There are no rules regarding how to move your characters, but two characters cannot be in the same position at the same time.
* If a character does not have a weapon, its attack is not going to affect other characters, since the range of its attack will be zero.
* After using a consumable item, it is automatically deleted.
